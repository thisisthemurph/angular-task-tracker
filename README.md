# TaskTracker

Yet another task tracker application allowing the user to complete standard CRUD operations.

## About

This project was undertaken to learn the basics of the Angular framework - it is not complete, useful, or asthetically pleasing.

I followed the below tutorial by Brad at Traversy Media:

- [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8&t=6426s)
- [Brad's Code](https://github.com/bradtraversy/angular-crash-202)

## Running

Run `npm run server` to start the backend json-api server and then `ng serve` to serve the frontend application.
